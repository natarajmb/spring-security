1. Whats the project?
Its a simple web application with few web pages to test spring security using different back ends.
Its a organic growth on the project and am using following solutions.
- In file
- In Memory
- JDBC
- JAP with Hibernate
- Embedded LDAP
- External LDAP
- CAS authentication


2. How to run/deployed?

To run or deploy the project, make sure you have tomcat 7 installed and running with following credentials in tomcat-users.xml

  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>

then run the following maven goal
"mvn package tomcat7:deploy" - to deploy for the first time
"mvn package tomcat7:redeploy" - to redeploy after changes

You should be able to see the project running on
http://localhost:8080/spring-security/

3. How to test each sub projects?

To test In file/memory functionality
------------------------------------
1. Enable the in-file section of authentication-manager in security xml and comment out rest of the authentication-manager sections in the file
2. Enable In file/memory section of the http tag in security xml
3. Add the remember me tag in security xml with "key" as a salt to encrypt
4. Add the remember me checkbox with specific name for a input type
5. Lower the session time out say to 1min to test

Testing:
1. Start the application login as user with remember me ticked
2. Wait for few minutes and refresh the page, you should still be logged in.

Negative testing:
1. Start the application login as user without remember me ticked
2. wait for few minutes and refresh the page, you would be asked to login again.

To test JDBC functionality
--------------------------
1. Enable the JDBC section of authentication-manager in security xml and comment out rest of the authentication-manager sections in the file
2. Enable JDBC section of the http tag in security xml
3. Check if the every required dependency in pom.xml is uncommented required for the JDBC testing.
   Note: All dependencies are grouped on functionality so it should be enabled by default. But cross check
4. Create the data base required using the script "jdbc_sql_script.sql"
5. Load the data into the created database from the sample file "jdbc_sql_sample_data.sql"
6. Adjust the dataSource bean in dispatcherServlet.xml to match your defined database and credentials
7. Adjust the authentication provider to point to the dataSource reference and add users-by-username-query and authorities-by-username-query property
8. Compile and deploy the application

Testing:
1. Star the application and login as the user from the sample data set
2. If you are able to login everything works as required

NOTE: To get this working comment following stuff
1. Following line from dispatcherServlet.xml
   <jpa:repositories base-package="com.cognitivenode.security.repository"/>
2. Remove package "com.cognitivenode.security.service" from context:component-scan

To test JPA/Hibernate functionality
-----------------------------------
1. Enable the JPA/Hibernate section of authentication-manager in security xml and comment out rest of the authentication-manager sections in the file
2. Enable JPA/Hibernate section of the http tag in security xml
3. Enable the Spring JPA section of the dispatcherServlet.xml
4. Adjust the dataSource bean in dispatcherServlet.xml to match your defined database and credentials
5. Compile and deploy, should you see the database dropped and created with sample data loaded

Testing:
1. Star the application and login as the user from the sample data set jpa_sample_data.sql
2. If you are able to login everything works as required

To test Embedded LDAP functionality
-----------------------------------
1. Enable the Embedded LDAP section of authentication-manager in security xml and comment out rest of the authentication-manager sections in the file
2. Remember me functionality has to be used either from JDBC or JPA implementation (see overview section about LDAP - http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/remember-me.html)
3. Comment out Spring JPA and JDBC dataSource definition section of the dispatcherServlet.xml
5. Compile and deploy

Testing:
1. Star the application and login as the user from the sample data set users.ldif
2. If you are able to login everything works as required except remember me functionality

To test External LDAP functionality
-----------------------------------
1. Enable the External LDAP section of authentication-manager in security xml and comment out rest of the authentication-manager sections in the file
2. Remember me functionality has to be used either from JDBC or JPA implementation (see overview section about LDAP - http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/remember-me.html)
3. Comment out Spring JPA and JDBC dataSource definition section of the dispatcherServlet.xml
5. Compile and deploy

Testing:
1. Install ApacheDS server and Apache Directory Studio (ADS) locally on your environment
2. Login to the ADS using "simple authentication" with credentials "uid=admin, ou=system" and password "secret"
3. Create a partition with id "cognitivenode" and suffix "dc=cognitivenode,dc=com" and restart the ApacheDS server
   ***** Restarting of the ApacheDS after adding partition is important if not this wont work ******
4. Import the users.ldif file from the resources folder
5. Test the application by logging in as user defined in users.ldif


Leaning points and errors encountered:
- Incorrect spring context file naming. It should always bee "<dispatcher_servlet_name>-servlet.xml"
- Incorrect filterChain configuration should be always named "springSecurityFilterChain"
- You can have multiple context files and can be split from servlet definition
- Spring security form need to follow this rules
  * Action should point to "j_spring_security_check"
  * Username and Password needs to be named "j_username" and "j_password"
  * If remember me functionality is used then the file name should be "_spring_security_remember_me"
  * You need to use "name" attribute of the input element for above input fields naming.
- JPA is easier to implement with Spring Data which takes away the pain of boiler plate code.
  * Make sure the names of the method matches the entity variable name else you will get this error "No property name found for type"
- Automatic data load using JPA was bit challenging as it requires the data set i.e. SQL script to be on each line
- Remember me functionality with secure token was challenging to implement and required following steps
  * Create a Entity to hold the persistence tokens
  * Implement a class to support PersistentTokenRepository for your desired back end in this case JPA & Hibernate
  * Define a bean tokenRepository with the above created class and wire it into remember me service (PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices)
  * Add a filter to filter and a provider to detect the token and auto login the user.
  * Make sure you use the same "key" i.e. salt value for both PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices & RememberMeAuthenticationProvider
- Remember me functionality implemented in JPA or JDBC needs to be reused for LDAP authentication (see overview section about LDAP - http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/remember-me.html)
